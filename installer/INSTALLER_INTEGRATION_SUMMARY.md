# Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor - Installer Integration Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the integration between the Electron-based installation wizard UI and the platform-specific installers (NSIS for Windows, DMG for macOS, and DEB/RPM for Linux). This integration allows users to configure their installation through a consistent, modern UI while still leveraging native installers for each platform.

## Completed Work

### Common Integration Framework

- Created a unified installer bridge (`installer_bridge.js`) that provides a common interface for all platforms
- Implemented platform detection and routing to the appropriate platform-specific bridge
- Added utility functions for default installation paths, data directories, and component handling
- Created a test framework to validate the integration on each platform

### Windows Integration

- Updated the NSIS installer script to accept configuration from the Electron wizard
- Implemented command-line parameter handling in the NSIS script
- Added support for component selection based on user preferences
- Modified the NetworkDiscoveryPage to use configuration from the Electron wizard
- Added first-run configuration based on installation choices

### macOS Integration

- Updated the DMG creation script to accept configuration from the Electron wizard
- Modified the post-installation script to configure the application based on user preferences
- Added support for component selection in the macOS installer
- Implemented conditional LaunchAgent creation based on auto-start preference
- Added first-run configuration based on installation choices

### Linux Integration

- Updated the package creation scripts for both DEB and RPM formats
- Modified the post-installation scripts to configure the application based on user preferences
- Added support for component selection in the Linux installers
- Implemented conditional systemd service configuration based on auto-start preference
- Added first-run configuration based on installation choices

### Documentation

- Created comprehensive README documentation for the installer integration
- Added comments to all code for better maintainability
- Updated the development roadmap to reflect completed work
- Created a test script to validate the integration

## Configuration Options

The integration supports passing the following configuration options from the Electron wizard to the platform-specific installers:

- Installation directory
- Data directory
- Desktop shortcut creation
- Start menu shortcut creation (Windows only)
- Auto-start at system boot
- Network discovery settings
- Component selection (core, database, dashboard, alert system, API, documentation)

## Next Steps

1. **Testing on All Platforms**: Thoroughly test the integration on Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure it works correctly in all environments.

2. **Signing and Notarization**: Implement code signing for Windows and macOS installers, and notarization for macOS to meet platform security requirements.

3. **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages in the installation wizard and installers.

4. **Automated Build Pipeline**: Create an automated build pipeline to generate installers for all platforms.

5. **User Documentation**: Create user documentation for the installation process, including screenshots and step-by-step instructions.

## Conclusion

The integration between the Electron-based installation wizard UI and the platform-specific installers is now complete. This provides a consistent, user-friendly installation experience across all supported platforms while still leveraging native installers for proper system integration. The next phase of development should focus on testing, signing, and preparing for public release.
