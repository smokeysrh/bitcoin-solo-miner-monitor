# Community Verification Guide

## Overview

This guide helps community members verify the authenticity and integrity of Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor releases through independent verification methods. As an open-source Bitcoin project, we believe in transparency and community-driven security validation.

## Why Community Verification Matters

- **Decentralized Trust**: No reliance on centralized certificate authorities
- **Open Source Principles**: Community can independently verify all software
- **Bitcoin Values**: Trustless verification aligns with Bitcoin's philosophy
- **Security**: Multiple independent verifications increase confidence

## Verification Methods

### 1. Checksum Verification (Basic)

**What it verifies**: File integrity and authenticity
**Skill level**: Beginner
**Time required**: 5-10 minutes

#### Steps:

1. **Download the installer** and the corresponding `SHA256SUMS` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/releases) page.

2. **Verify checksums** using our verification tool:
   ```bash
   # Download the verification script
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/main/tools/verification/verify-checksums.py
   
   # Verify the downloaded installer
   python3 tools/verification/verify-checksums.py SHA256SUMS
   ```

3. **Manual verification** (alternative method):
   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   Get-FileHash BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
   ```

4. **Check the output**: You should see âœ… for successful verification.

### 2. Reproducible Build Verification (Advanced)

**What it verifies**: Build process integrity and source code authenticity
**Skill level**: Advanced
**Time required**: 30-60 minutes

#### Prerequisites:
- Git
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Platform-specific build tools (see [BUILD.md](../docs/BUILD.md))

#### Steps:

1. **Use our automated verification script**:
   ```bash
   # Download and run verification
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/main/tools/build/verify-reproducible-build.sh
   chmod +x verify-reproducible-build.sh
   ./verify-reproducible-build.sh v0.1.0 SHA256SUMS
   ```

2. **Manual reproducible build**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor.git
   cd bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor
   
   # Checkout the specific version
   git checkout v0.1.0
   
   # Run reproducible build
   ./tools/build/build-reproducible.sh 0.1.0
   
   # Compare checksums
   diff SHA256SUMS distribution/SHA256SUMS
   ```

3. **Report your results** using our [verification reporting system](#reporting-verification-results).

### 3. Source Code Audit (Expert)

**What it verifies**: Source code security and functionality
**Skill level**: Expert
**Time required**: 2-8 hours

#### Steps:

1. **Clone and review source code**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor.git
   cd bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor
   git checkout v0.1.0
   ```

2. **Review key security areas**:
   - Network communication (`src/backend/api/`)
   - Mining pool connections (`src/backend/mining/`)
   - Configuration handling (`config/`)
   - Build and installer scripts (`installer/`, `scripts/`)

3. **Run security analysis tools**:
   ```bash
   # Python security analysis
   pip install bandit safety
   bandit -r src/
   safety check -r requirements.txt
   
   # JavaScript security analysis
   cd src/frontend
   npm audit
   ```

4. **Document findings** and report through our [security reporting process](#security-issue-reporting).

## Reporting Verification Results

### Successful Verification

If your verification succeeds, you can help the community by reporting your successful verification:

1. **Create a verification report** using our [Verification Success template](https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/issues/new?template=verification-success.md)

2. **Include the following information**:
   - Version verified
   - Verification method used
   - Platform and environment details
   - Checksum comparison results
   - Any additional notes

### Failed Verification

If verification fails, this could indicate a security issue:

1. **Do not use the software** until the issue is resolved
2. **Report immediately** using our [Verification Failure template](https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/issues/new?template=verification-failure.md)
3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Expected vs actual checksums
   - Build environment details
   - Complete error logs
   - Steps to reproduce

### Security Issue Reporting

For security vulnerabilities discovered during verification:

1. **For critical security issues**: Email security@bitcoinminer.local (if available) or create a private security advisory
2. **For non-critical issues**: Use our [Security Issue template](https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/issues/new?template=security-issue.md)
