# BitcoinLoadingSpinner Component Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: ✅ Update BitcoinLoadingSpinner component

### Implementation Details

#### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced logo placeholder** with BitcoinLogo component in template
2. **Added BitcoinLogo import** and component registration
3. **Integrated computed logoSize** property for dynamic sizing
4. **Maintained existing functionality** including animations and accessibility
5. **Preserved proper positioning** with z-index layering

#### Code Changes:

**Template Updates:**
- Replaced `<div class="bitcoin-spinner__logo-placeholder"></div>` 
- Added `<BitcoinLogo :size="logoSize" variant="default" :animated="false" :aria-label="`Bitcoin logo ${logoSize}px`" class="bitcoin-spinner__logo" />`

**Script Updates:**
- Added `import BitcoinLogo from "./BitcoinLogo.vue";`
- Added `BitcoinLogo` to components registration
- Maintained existing `logoSize` computed property

**CSS Positioning:**
- Logo uses `position: relative` with `z-index: 2` (above ring)
- Ring uses `position: absolute` with `z-index: 1` (behind logo)
- Logo is properly centered within the spinning ring

### Size Variants Tested:
- **Small (sm):** 48px container → 24px logo
- **Medium (md):** 64px container → 32px logo  
- **Large (lg):** 96px container → 48px logo
- **Extra Large (xl):** 128px container → 64px logo
- **Custom numeric:** Logo is 50% of container size
