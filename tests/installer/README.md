# Cross-Platform Installer Testing System

This directory contains a comprehensive testing automation system for Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor installers across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

## Overview

The testing system implements automated testing matrices, user experience simulation, and installation success rate monitoring to ensure high-quality installer distribution across all supported platforms.

## Components

### 1. Cross-Platform Testing Automation (`test_cross_platform_automation.py`)

Comprehensive automated testing system that validates:

- **Installer Integrity**: File size, checksums, and basic structure validation
- **Platform Compatibility**: Tests installers on their target platforms
- **Installation Simulation**: Simulates installation processes without requiring admin privileges
- **Application Launch Testing**: Verifies installed applications can start successfully

**Features:**
- Supports all installer types: `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`
- Automated checksum verification against `SHA256SUMS` files
- Platform-specific validation (NSIS on Windows, DMG mounting on macOS, package structure on Linux)
- Detailed test reporting with JSON and Markdown outputs
- Configurable timeouts and retry mechanisms

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test all installers in distribution directory
python test_cross_platform_automation.py

# Test specific installer file
python test_cross_platform_automation.py --installer-file path/to/installer.exe

# Test with verbose logging
python test_cross_platform_automation.py --verbose
```

### 2. User Experience Simulator (`user_experience_simulator.py`)

Simulates real-world user interactions with different user personas:

**User Personas:**
- **Novice Bitcoin Miner**: Non-technical user, uses defaults, low patience for errors
- **Experienced Bitcoin Miner**: Intermediate technical skills, customizes settings, handles warnings
- **Tech-Savvy User**: Advanced user, skips wizards, manually configures everything

**Simulation Areas:**
- Download and file handling experience
- Security warning responses (antivirus, "Unknown Publisher")
- Installation process with different user behaviors
- First application launch and setup wizard
- Initial miner configuration and discovery

**Metrics Tracked:**
- User satisfaction scores (1-10 scale)
- Installation completion rates by persona
- Common pain points and positive experiences
- Time-to-completion for different user types

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run UX simulation for all personas
python user_experience_simulator.py

# Test specific installer directory
python user_experience_simulator.py --installer-dir path/to/installers

# Enable verbose logging
python user_experience_simulator.py --verbose
```

### 3. Installation Success Monitor (`installation_success_monitor.py`)

Tracks and analyzes installation success rates over time:

**Features:**
- SQLite database for persistent tracking
- Success rate calculation by platform, installer type, and user persona
- Trend analysis and alerting system
- Failure pattern analysis and common error tracking
- Automated alert generation for critical issues

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Overall success rate tracking
- Platform-specific performance monitoring
- User persona success rate analysis
- Historical trend detection
- Critical failure rate alerting

**Database Schema:**
- `installation_tests`: Individual test results
- `success_rate_snapshots`: Aggregated success rate data
- `alerts`: System-generated alerts and notifications

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate monitoring report for last 30 days
python installation_success_monitor.py --generate-report --days 30

# Import test results from JSON file
python installation_success_monitor.py --import-results test_results.json

# Check for critical alerts
python installation_success_monitor.py --check-alerts
```

### 4. Comprehensive Test Runner (`run_cross_platform_tests.py`)

Orchestrates all testing components into a unified test suite:

**Features:**
- Runs all test types in coordinated sequence
- Consolidates results from multiple test components
- Generates comprehensive reports with actionable recommendations
- Configurable test type selection
- Quality gate evaluation for release readiness

**Test Orchestration:**
1. Cross-platform installer validation
2. User experience simulation across all personas
3. Success rate monitoring and trend analysis
4. Comprehensive report generation with recommendations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run complete test suite
python run_cross_platform_tests.py

# Skip specific test types
python run_cross_platform_tests.py --skip-user-experience

# Test specific installer directory
python run_cross_platform_tests.py --installer-dir path/to/installers
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

## Configuration

### Test Configuration

The testing system uses configuration objects to control behavior:

```python
config = {
    "success_rate_thresholds": {
        "excellent": 95.0,
        "good": 85.0,
        "acceptable": 75.0,
        "poor": 60.0
    },
    "timeout_seconds": 300,
    "retry_attempts": 3,
    "platforms": ["windows", "macos", "linux"]
}
```

### User Persona Configuration

User personas are configurable with different behavior patterns:

```python
persona_behaviors = {
    "installation": {
        "reads_instructions": True/False,
        "uses_default_settings": True/False,
        "patience_seconds": 30-300,
        "likely_to_quit_on_error": True/False
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Running Tests Locally

1. **Prepare Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install requests packaging sqlite3
   
   # Ensure installer files are available
   ls distribution/
   ```

2. **Run Individual Components**:
   ```bash
   # Test installer integrity first
   python test_cross_platform_automation.py --verbose
   
   # Then run UX simulation
   python user_experience_simulator.py --verbose
   
   # Finally check monitoring
   python installation_success_monitor.py --generate-report
   ```

3. **Run Comprehensive Suite**:
   ```bash
   # Complete test suite
   python run_cross_platform_tests.py --verbose
   ```

### Interpreting Results

**Success Rate Interpretation:**
- **95%+**: Excellent - Ready for release
- **85-94%**: Good - Minor issues to address
- **75-84%**: Acceptable - Needs improvement
- **60-74%**: Poor - Significant issues
- **<60%**: Critical - Do not release

**User Satisfaction Interpretation:**
- **8.0+**: Excellent user experience
- **6.0-7.9**: Good user experience
- **4.0-5.9**: Needs improvement
- **<4.0**: Poor user experience

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **No Installer Files Found**:
   - Verify distribution directory exists
   - Check installer file extensions are recognized
   - Ensure build process completed successfully

2. **Platform-Specific Test Failures**:
   - Check platform-specific dependencies (NSIS, hdiutil, dpkg)
   - Verify file permissions on executable files
   - Review platform-specific error messages

3. **Database Issues**:
