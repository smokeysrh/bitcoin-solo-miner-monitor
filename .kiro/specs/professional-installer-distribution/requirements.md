# Professional Installer Distribution - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the implementation of user-friendly installer distribution for the Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor open-source application. The goal is to transform the current developer-oriented ZIP distribution into platform-specific installers that provide a seamless experience for non-technical users while maintaining the transparency and community trust values of open-source Bitcoin projects.

The implementation follows a three-phase approach: Windows NSIS installer activation, community trust through transparency, and cross-platform distribution channels. This systematic approach ensures maximum user adoption by eliminating technical barriers while embracing open-source principles of reproducible builds and community verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Windows NSIS Installer Activation

**User Story:** As a Windows user downloading Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor, I want to double-click a single .exe file and have the application install automatically with all dependencies, so that I don't need technical knowledge or manual setup steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads the Windows installer THEN they SHALL receive a single .exe file that requires no additional downloads
2. WHEN a user runs the installer THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and install Python runtime dependencies if not present
3. WHEN the installation completes THEN the system SHALL create desktop shortcuts and Start menu entries automatically
4. WHEN the installation completes THEN the system SHALL register the application in Windows Add/Remove Programs with proper uninstall functionality
5. WHEN a user runs the installed application THEN it SHALL launch without requiring command-line interaction or technical setup
6. WHEN the installer runs THEN it SHALL display professional branding with Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor logos and consistent visual design
7. WHEN installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2: Build System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer releasing Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor, I want an automated build system that creates the Windows installer from source code, so that I can reliably produce consistent installer packages for distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL automatically compile the Python backend and build the Vue.js frontend
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL bundle all required dependencies including Python runtime into the installer package
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL generate the NSIS installer executable with proper version information and metadata
4. WHEN the build completes THEN it SHALL produce a distributable .exe file ready for end-user download
5. WHEN the build process encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide clear diagnostic information for troubleshooting
6. WHEN the build runs on different machines THEN it SHALL produce identical installer outputs for the same source code version
7. WHEN version information changes THEN the build system SHALL automatically update installer metadata and file properties

### Requirement 3: Community Trust Through Transparency

**User Story:** As a Bitcoin user downloading an open-source mining tool, I want to verify the software authenticity through reproducible builds and community verification, so that I can trust the software without relying on expensive certificate authorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads any installer THEN they SHALL have access to SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
2. WHEN a user wants to verify authenticity THEN they SHALL be able to reproduce the exact same build from source code
3. WHEN installers are released THEN they SHALL include clear documentation about expected security warnings and how to proceed safely
4. WHEN users encounter "Unknown Publisher" warnings THEN they SHALL have access to clear instructions explaining this is normal for open-source software
5. WHEN builds are created THEN the build process SHALL be fully documented and reproducible on any compatible system
6. WHEN users want additional verification THEN they SHALL be able to compare checksums with community-verified builds
7. WHEN security concerns arise THEN the community SHALL have transparent access to source code and build processes for independent verification

### Requirement 4: macOS DMG Package Implementation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a macOS user downloads the installer THEN they SHALL receive a .dmg disk image file
2. WHEN the user opens the .dmg file THEN it SHALL display a professional installer window with drag-to-Applications instructions
3. WHEN the user drags the application to Applications THEN all dependencies SHALL be included and functional
4. WHEN the installation completes THEN the application SHALL appear in Launchpad and Applications folder
5. WHEN the user first runs the application THEN macOS SHALL recognize it as properly notarized software
6. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL have proper macOS integration including dock icons and menu bar behavior
7. WHEN the user wants to uninstall THEN they SHALL be able to simply drag the application to Trash

### Requirement 5: Community Distribution Channels

**User Story:** As a Linux user, I want to install Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor through trusted community channels like package managers and repositories, so that I get proper dependency management and benefit from community verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packages are submitted to community repositories THEN they SHALL follow each distribution's packaging guidelines and security requirements
2. WHEN users install through package managers THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve and install all dependencies
3. WHEN packages are available THEN they SHALL be distributed through multiple channels (GitHub releases, AUR, Homebrew, etc.)
4. WHEN the package installs THEN it SHALL create proper desktop entries and application menu integration
5. WHEN a user wants to uninstall THEN the package manager SHALL cleanly remove all installed files and configurations
6. WHEN packages are updated THEN the system SHALL preserve user configurations and data
7. WHEN community maintainers package the software THEN they SHALL have access to clear packaging documentation and support

### Requirement 6: Open Source Release Pipeline

**User Story:** As an open-source project maintainer, I want an automated GitHub Actions system that builds and publishes installers for all platforms when I create a new release, so that I can efficiently distribute updates while maintaining full transparency of the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new version tag is created THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically trigger reproducible builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. WHEN all platform builds complete successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically publish installers to GitHub Releases with detailed release notes
3. WHEN any platform build fails THEN the system SHALL halt the release process and provide detailed build logs for community troubleshooting
4. WHEN builds complete THEN the system SHALL generate and publish SHA256 checksums for all installer files
5. WHEN the release publishes THEN it SHALL update documentation and provide clear installation instructions for each platform
6. WHEN users check for updates THEN the application SHALL be able to detect new GitHub releases and notify users
7. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN all build logs and processes SHALL be publicly visible for community verification and audit

### Requirement 7: User Experience Validation

**User Story:** As a non-technical Bitcoin miner, I want the installation process to be as simple as installing any other professional software, so that I can focus on mining rather than technical setup challenges.
