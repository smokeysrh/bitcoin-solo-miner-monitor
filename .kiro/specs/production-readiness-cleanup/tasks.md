# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Organize test files and remove development-only utilities

  - Create tests/ directory structure and move all test_*.py files from root to appropriate test directories
  - Remove debug_server.py as it's development-only (not needed for production testing)
  - Delete add_mock_miners.py and clear_test_data.py scripts (development utilities only)
  - Keep legitimate test files but organize them properly outside production code paths
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Clean up mock data and hardcoded test configurations

  - Remove hardcoded IP addresses (192.168.1.100, 192.168.1.101, 192.168.1.102) from any remaining configuration files
  - Delete data/setup-complete.json if it contains mock setup data
  - Remove any hardcoded mock miner configurations from source code
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Update production configuration settings
  - Change DEBUG = True to DEBUG = False in config/app_config.py
  - Update HOST setting from "127.0.0.1" to "0.0.0.0" for production deployment
  - Set LOG_LEVEL from "INFO" to "WARNING" for production logging
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Harden API security and secure development endpoints
  - Update CORS settings in src/backend/api/api_service.py from allow_origins=["*"] to specific allowed domains
  - Secure the /api/reload-miners endpoint with authentication/authorization if needed in production, or disable it
  - Review all API endpoints to determine which are production-necessary vs development-only
  - Add proper authentication/rate limiting to sensitive endpoints rather than removing them
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Update network and connection configurations
  - Review and update any hardcoded localhost URLs in source code to use configurable endpoints
  - Update connection timeout and retry values to production-appropriate settings
  - Ensure all network communication uses proper error handling for real network conditions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Validate application functionality after cleanup
  - Run existing unit tests to ensure no functionality was broken by cleanup changes
  - Test application startup with production configuration settings
  - Verify API endpoints still function correctly after security hardening
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Create production deployment documentation
  - Document the production configuration requirements and setup steps
  - Create deployment checklist for production environment setup
  - Document any remaining manual configuration steps needed for production deployment
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_
