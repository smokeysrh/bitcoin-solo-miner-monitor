# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on preparing the mining application for deployment and testing on real networks with actual miners. The primary goal is to systematically identify, review, and remove all mock data, temporary code, debug utilities, and development-only artifacts that could interfere with production operation or create security vulnerabilities. This cleanup ensures the application operates reliably with real mining hardware and network conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all mock data and temporary test code removed from the production codebase, so that the application only processes real miner data and operates in a production-ready state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is scanned THEN the system SHALL identify all files containing mock data, test utilities, or temporary code
2. WHEN mock data generators are found THEN the system SHALL remove or disable them to prevent interference with real data
3. WHEN temporary debug files are identified THEN the system SHALL remove them from the production codebase
4. IF test utilities exist in production paths THEN the system SHALL relocate them to appropriate test directories or remove them entirely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of all configuration settings and hardcoded values, so that I can ensure no development-specific configurations will affect production operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are reviewed THEN the system SHALL identify all hardcoded development values, test endpoints, and debug flags
2. WHEN database configurations are examined THEN the system SHALL ensure no test database connections or mock data schemas remain
3. WHEN API endpoints are audited THEN the system SHALL verify no debug or test-only endpoints are exposed in production
4. IF development-specific logging levels are found THEN the system SHALL update them to production-appropriate levels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network operator, I want all network communication code reviewed for production readiness, so that the application can reliably connect to and communicate with real mining hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connection code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL ensure no hardcoded test IP addresses or mock network responses remain
2. WHEN miner communication protocols are examined THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with real mining hardware specifications
3. WHEN error handling is audited THEN the system SHALL ensure robust handling of real network conditions and miner responses
4. IF timeout values are hardcoded for testing THEN the system SHALL update them to production-appropriate values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive validation that the cleanup process maintains application functionality, so that production deployment doesn't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup changes are made THEN the system SHALL run all existing tests to verify functionality is preserved
2. WHEN mock data is removed THEN the system SHALL ensure alternative data sources or user input mechanisms are properly implemented
3. WHEN configuration changes are applied THEN the system SHALL validate that all required production configurations are present and valid
4. IF critical functionality depends on removed components THEN the system SHALL implement proper production alternatives before removal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all development artifacts and debug information removed, so that no sensitive development data or attack vectors are exposed in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug endpoints are identified THEN the system SHALL remove or secure them to prevent unauthorized access
2. WHEN development credentials or API keys are found THEN the system SHALL remove them and ensure production credentials are properly configured
3. WHEN verbose logging or debug output is discovered THEN the system SHALL reduce it to production-appropriate levels
4. IF development-only features expose system internals THEN the system SHALL disable or remove them entirely
