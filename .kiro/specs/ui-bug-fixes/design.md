# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the technical approach to fix critical UI/UX bugs in the Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor application. The application is built with Vue.js 3, Vuetify 3, and a Python FastAPI backend. The fixes target save functionality, navigation consistency, dashboard feature parity, and visual elements.

## Architecture

The application follows a standard Vue.js architecture:
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Vuetify 3 for UI components
- **State Management**: Pinia stores for miners, settings, and alerts
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with SQLite database
- **Communication**: HTTP API calls and WebSocket for real-time updates

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Save Functionality Fix

**Affected Components:**
- `App.vue` - Settings dialog save functionality
- `src/stores/settings.js` - Settings store
- `src/backend/api/settings.py` - Settings API endpoints

**Current Issues:**
- Save button in settings dialog doesn't trigger actual save operation
- Dashboard settings save button is non-functional
- No user feedback on save success/failure
- Settings window doesn't close after successful save

**Design Solution:**
- Implement proper save method in settings store that calls backend API
- Add success/error notifications using existing snackbar system
- Auto-close settings dialog on successful save
- Add loading state to prevent duplicate submissions

### 2. Add Miner Button Consistency

**Affected Components:**
- `App.vue` - Main add miner dialog and button
- `Dashboard.vue` - Empty state add miner button
- `SimpleDashboard.vue` - Quick actions add miner button
- Various other components with add miner functionality

**Current Issues:**
- Different context fields across add miner buttons
- Some buttons have no functionality
- Inconsistent styling and behavior

**Design Solution:**
- Centralize add miner functionality in App.vue
- Use custom events to trigger the main add miner dialog from any component
- Ensure all buttons use the same dialog with identical fields
- Standardize button styling and behavior

### 3. Sidebar Scrolling Behavior

**Affected Components:**
- `App.vue` - Navigation drawer implementation

**Current Issues:**
- Sidebar is static and doesn't scroll with page content
- Navigation becomes inaccessible when scrolling down

**Design Solution:**
- Change navigation drawer from `app` positioning to relative positioning
- Implement CSS that allows sidebar to scroll with page content
- Ensure sidebar remains visible at all scroll positions
- Maintain responsive behavior on mobile devices

### 4. Dashboard Quick Actions Parity

**Affected Components:**
- `Dashboard.vue` - Normal dashboard
- `SimpleDashboard.vue` - Simple dashboard

**Current Issues:**
- Simple dashboard has quick action buttons
- Normal dashboard lacks these same quick action buttons
- Inconsistent user experience between dashboard modes

**Design Solution:**
- Add quick actions section to normal dashboard
- Ensure identical functionality between both dashboards
- Maintain consistent styling and positioning
- Use shared components where possible

### 5. BTC Logo Loading Spinner Fix

**Affected Components:**
- `BitcoinLogo.vue` - Logo component
- `BitcoinLoadingSpinner.vue` - Loading spinner component (if exists)
- CSS animations and styling

**Current Issues:**
- Loading spinner appears misaligned or distorted
- Animation may not be smooth or professional looking

**Design Solution:**
- Review and fix CSS positioning and sizing
- Ensure proper centering and proportions
- Smooth animation transitions
- Responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Proper accessibility considerations

## Data Models

### Settings Data Model
```javascript
{
  polling_interval: Number,     // Seconds between miner polls
  refresh_interval: Number,     // UI refresh interval
  chart_retention_days: Number, // Data retention period
  // Additional settings as needed
}
```

### Miner Data Model
```javascript
{
  id: String,
  type: String,        // 'bitaxe', 'avalon_nano', 'magic_miner'
  ip_address: String,
  port: Number,
  name: String,
  status: String,      // 'online', 'offline', 'error'
  hashrate: Number,
  temperature: Number
}
```

## Error Handling

### Save Operations
- Validate input data before sending to backend
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Display specific error messages to users
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Log errors for debugging purposes

### UI State Management
- Prevent duplicate operations with loading states
- Handle component unmounting during async operations
- Maintain consistent UI state across components
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable

### Navigation and Routing
- Handle route changes during operations
- Maintain scroll position when appropriate
- Ensure accessibility during navigation state changes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test save functionality with mocked API calls
- Test add miner dialog behavior and validation
- Test sidebar positioning and scroll behavior
- Test quick actions functionality
- Test logo component rendering and animations

### Integration Tests
- Test complete save workflow from UI to backend
- Test add miner workflow across different entry points
- Test dashboard switching and feature parity
- Test responsive behavior across screen sizes

### Visual Regression Tests
- Test logo spinner appearance and animation
- Test sidebar positioning at different scroll positions
- Test button consistency across components
- Test dialog appearance and behavior

### Accessibility Tests
- Test keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Test high contrast mode support
- Test reduced motion preferences

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Save Functionality
1. Fix settings store save method
2. Implement proper API integration
3. Add user feedback notifications
4. Add auto-close behavior

### Phase 2: Add Miner Consistency
1. Audit all add miner button locations
2. Centralize functionality in App.vue
3. Implement event-based communication
4. Standardize styling and behavior

### Phase 3: Sidebar Behavior
1. Modify navigation drawer CSS
2. Test scroll behavior across devices
3. Ensure responsive design integrity
4. Validate accessibility compliance

### Phase 4: Dashboard Parity
1. Add quick actions to normal dashboard
2. Ensure feature consistency
3. Test switching between dashboard modes
4. Validate responsive behavior

### Phase 5: Logo Spinner Fix
1. Analyze current spinner implementation
2. Fix CSS positioning and animations
3. Test across different screen sizes
4. Ensure accessibility compliance

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize DOM manipulations during scroll events
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Implement proper component lifecycle management
- Optimize API calls to prevent unnecessary requests
- Use proper Vue.js reactivity patterns

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data before sending to backend
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Use secure communication protocols for API calls

## Browser Compatibility

- Ensure compatibility with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
- Validate CSS animations across different browsers
- Implement fallbacks for unsupported features
