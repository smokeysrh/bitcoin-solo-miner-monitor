# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user interface and user experience bugs that are impacting the application's usability. The bugs span across settings functionality, navigation consistency, dashboard features, and visual elements. These fixes are essential for providing a polished and functional user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all save functionality (settings and dashboard settings) to work properly and provide clear feedback, so that I can confidently save my configuration changes and know when they've been applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks any Save button (settings or dashboard settings) THEN the system SHALL save the current configuration to the database
2. WHEN configuration is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL display a success notification to the user
3. WHEN settings are successfully saved THEN the system SHALL automatically close the settings window
4. WHEN dashboard settings are successfully saved THEN the system SHALL apply the changes immediately to the dashboard
5. WHEN any save operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details about the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all "Add Miner" buttons to have consistent functionality and context fields, so that I can reliably add miners regardless of where I access the feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user encounters any "Add Miner" button THEN the system SHALL provide identical context fields across all instances
2. WHEN a user clicks any "Add Miner" button THEN the system SHALL open the same add miner dialog/form
3. WHEN a user completes the add miner process THEN the system SHALL behave consistently regardless of which button was used
4. IF an "Add Miner" button currently has no function THEN the system SHALL implement the proper functionality
5. WHEN reviewing all "Add Miner" buttons THEN the system SHALL ensure they all have the same visual styling and behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar menu to scroll with the page content and remain visible at all times, so that I can access navigation options regardless of my current scroll position.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls down the page THEN the sidebar menu SHALL move with the page content
2. WHEN a user scrolls to any position on the page THEN the sidebar menu SHALL remain fully visible
3. WHEN the sidebar is open THEN the system SHALL ensure it doesn't interfere with page content readability
4. WHEN a user reaches the bottom of the page THEN the sidebar menu SHALL still be accessible
5. WHEN a user reaches the top of the page THEN the sidebar menu SHALL be in its original position

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the same quick action buttons available on both the simple and normal dashboards, so that I have consistent access to important functions regardless of which dashboard view I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the simple dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all quick action buttons
2. WHEN a user views the normal dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the same quick action buttons as the simple dashboard
3. WHEN a user clicks any quick action button THEN the system SHALL perform the same function regardless of which dashboard they're on
4. WHEN comparing dashboards THEN the system SHALL ensure quick action buttons have identical styling and positioning
5. WHEN new quick action buttons are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they appear on both dashboard types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the BTC logo loading spinner to display correctly and professionally, so that the loading state appears polished and doesn't detract from the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BTC logo loading spinner is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a properly centered and proportioned spinner
2. WHEN the loading spinner animates THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth rotation without visual artifacts
3. WHEN the loading spinner is shown THEN the system SHALL ensure the BTC logo remains clearly visible and recognizable
4. WHEN the loading process completes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition from the spinner to the loaded content
5. WHEN the spinner is displayed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper proportions and positioning
