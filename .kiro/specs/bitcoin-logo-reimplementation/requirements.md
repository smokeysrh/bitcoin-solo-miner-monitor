# Bitcoin Logo Reimplementation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for reimplementing the Bitcoin logo system across the Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor application using the freshly downloaded official Bitcoin logos. The previous logo system was completely removed to eliminate custom logos with off-center "B" symbols, and now we need to implement a clean, streamlined system using only the official Bitcoin symbols.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Logo Component

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable BitcoinLogo Vue component, so that I can consistently display Bitcoin logos throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BitcoinLogo component is created THEN it SHALL use only the official bitcoin-symbol.svg and bitcoin-symbol.png files from the assets/ directory
2. WHEN the component receives a size prop THEN it SHALL render the appropriate logo size (16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px+)
3. WHEN size is 32px or smaller THEN the component SHALL use bitcoin-symbol.svg for crisp rendering
4. WHEN size is larger than 32px THEN the component SHALL use bitcoin-symbol.png for better quality
5. WHEN the component is used THEN it SHALL support accessibility attributes (alt text, aria-label)
6. WHEN the component is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio and centering

### Requirement 2: Backend API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want API endpoints to serve Bitcoin logo files, so that the logos can be accessed via standard HTTP requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to /bitcoin-symbol.svg THEN the server SHALL serve the official SVG logo from assets/bitcoin-symbol.svg
2. WHEN a request is made to /bitcoin-symbol.png THEN the server SHALL serve the official PNG logo from assets/bitcoin-symbol.png
3. WHEN logo files are served THEN they SHALL include proper MIME types (image/svg+xml, image/png)
4. WHEN logo files are requested THEN they SHALL be served with appropriate caching headers
5. WHEN logo files don't exist THEN the server SHALL return 404 with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3: Application Header Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the Bitcoin logo in the application header, so that I can easily identify the application and its purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main application loads THEN the app bar SHALL display a Bitcoin logo next to the title
2. WHEN the navigation drawer is open THEN it SHALL display a Bitcoin logo in the header section
3. WHEN logos are displayed in headers THEN they SHALL use appropriate sizes (24px for app bar, 32px for drawer)
4. WHEN header logos are rendered THEN they SHALL maintain consistent spacing and alignment
5. WHEN the application is in setup mode THEN header logos SHALL be hidden to avoid conflicts with wizard branding

### Requirement 4: Setup Wizard Integration

**User Story:** As a user going through setup, I want to see Bitcoin logos in the wizard, so that the setup process feels cohesive with the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the setup wizard loads THEN the wizard header SHALL display a prominent Bitcoin logo
2. WHEN the welcome screen is shown THEN it SHALL display a large hero Bitcoin logo (64px or larger)
3. WHEN the network discovery screen loads THEN it SHALL display a medium Bitcoin logo (32px)
4. WHEN wizard logos are displayed THEN they SHALL support animations and visual effects
5. WHEN the setup is complete THEN logos SHALL transition smoothly to the main application

### Requirement 5: About Page Hero Section

**User Story:** As a user viewing the About page, I want to see a prominent Bitcoin logo, so that the page clearly represents the application's Bitcoin focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the About page loads THEN it SHALL display a large hero Bitcoin logo at the top
2. WHEN the hero logo is rendered THEN it SHALL be centered and prominently displayed
3. WHEN the hero logo is shown THEN it SHALL use the largest available size (64px+)
4. WHEN the page is responsive THEN the logo SHALL scale appropriately for different screen sizes
5. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL include proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### Requirement 6: Loading and Success Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see Bitcoin logos in loading spinners and success messages, so that these components maintain visual consistency with the application theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BitcoinLoadingSpinner is displayed THEN it SHALL show a Bitcoin logo in the center of the spinner
2. WHEN BitcoinSuccessMessage is shown THEN it SHALL display a Bitcoin logo as part of the success icon
3. WHEN loading components are rendered THEN logos SHALL be appropriately sized for the component context
4. WHEN success messages are displayed THEN the Bitcoin logo SHALL complement the checkmark or success indicator
5. WHEN these components are used THEN they SHALL maintain accessibility and animation performance

### Requirement 7: CSS and Styling Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSS classes and utilities for Bitcoin logos, so that I can easily style and position logos throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS classes are created THEN they SHALL provide consistent sizing options (.bitcoin-logo-sm, .bitcoin-logo-md, etc.)
2. WHEN background image utilities are implemented THEN they SHALL reference the correct logo files
3. WHEN CSS is applied THEN it SHALL ensure proper logo positioning and scaling
4. WHEN styles are defined THEN they SHALL support both light and dark themes
5. WHEN CSS utilities are used THEN they SHALL maintain performance and avoid layout shifts

### Requirement 8: Critical Resource Preloading

**User Story:** As a user, I want Bitcoin logos to load quickly, so that the application feels responsive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN critical Bitcoin logo resources SHALL be preloaded
2. WHEN preloading is implemented THEN it SHALL prioritize the most commonly used logo sizes
3. WHEN resources are preloaded THEN it SHALL not negatively impact initial page load performance
4. WHEN logos are cached THEN they SHALL be available for immediate display on subsequent page loads
5. WHEN preloading fails THEN the application SHALL gracefully fallback to normal loading

### Requirement 9: Easter Egg Integration

**User Story:** As a user who discovers easter eggs, I want Bitcoin logos to be part of the interactive experience, so that the easter eggs feel integrated with the application theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN easter egg functionality is active THEN it SHALL be able to reference Bitcoin logo URLs
2. WHEN easter egg animations are triggered THEN they SHALL use the official Bitcoin logos
3. WHEN logo animations are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain performance and not cause layout issues
4. WHEN easter eggs are disabled THEN logo functionality SHALL remain unaffected
5. WHEN accessibility settings reduce motion THEN logo animations SHALL respect user preferences

### Requirement 10: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and development tools for the logo system, so that I can ensure reliability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logo component is tested THEN it SHALL have unit tests covering all size variations
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN they SHALL verify correct file serving and error handling
3. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL verify logos display correctly across all pages
4. WHEN the development server runs THEN logo files SHALL be served correctly in development mode
5. WHEN the application is built for production THEN logo assets SHALL be properly included and optimized

## Success Criteria

- All placeholder comments are replaced with functional Bitcoin logo implementations
- The application displays consistent, properly-sized Bitcoin logos across all pages
- Logo loading is fast and doesn't impact application performance
- The logo system is maintainable and follows Vue.js best practices
- All logos use only the official Bitcoin symbols from the assets/ directory
- No custom or off-center "B" logos remain in the application
