# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical bugs and usability issues identified in the mining dashboard application during final testing phase. The focus is on fixing existing functionality without introducing new features, ensuring proper debugging procedures, and comprehensive testing of all fixes to maintain application stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Information Bubble Functionality

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want interactive information bubbles that respond to hover and click events, so that I can access helpful explanations about dashboard features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over an information bubble ("?") THEN the system SHALL display a visual hover effect with size increase and/or color change
2. WHEN a user clicks on an information bubble THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip or popup with relevant explanatory text
3. WHEN an information bubble is displayed THEN the system SHALL size it appropriately to not overwhelm the interface
4. WHEN a user clicks outside an open information bubble THEN the system SHALL close the tooltip/popup

### Requirement 2: Dashboard Button Functionality

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want all primary action buttons (Scan Network, Add Miner, Analytics) to perform their intended functions, so that I can effectively manage my mining operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Scan Network" button THEN the system SHALL initiate network scanning functionality and provide visual feedback
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Add Miner" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to or display the add miner interface
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Analytics" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to or display the analytics interface
4. WHEN any button is clicked THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback indicating the action was registered

### Requirement 3: Theme Switching Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Dark/Light theme toggle to properly change the application's visual appearance, so that I can customize the interface to my preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches from Dark to Light theme THEN the system SHALL update all interface colors to the light theme palette
2. WHEN a user switches from Light to Dark theme THEN the system SHALL update all interface colors to the dark theme palette
3. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN the system SHALL persist the theme choice across browser sessions
4. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT display visual glitches or flickering beyond normal transition effects

### Requirement 4: Simple Mode Toggle Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Simple Mode toggle to properly switch between dashboard views, so that I can choose the interface complexity that suits my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user toggles Simple Mode ON THEN the system SHALL display a simplified dashboard interface with reduced complexity
2. WHEN a user toggles Simple Mode OFF THEN the system SHALL display the full-featured dashboard interface
3. WHEN Simple Mode state changes THEN the system SHALL persist the setting across browser sessions
4. WHEN a user completes setup wizard with "Simple Dashboard" selected THEN the Simple Mode toggle SHALL function regardless of initial setup choice

### Requirement 5: Footer Consistency

**User Story:** As a user navigating between Dashboard, Miners, and Network pages, I want consistent footer sizing across all pages, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Dashboard page THEN the system SHALL display a footer with standardized height and styling
2. WHEN a user views the Miners page THEN the system SHALL display a footer identical in size and styling to other pages
3. WHEN a user views the Network page THEN the system SHALL display a footer identical in size and styling to other pages
4. WHEN footer sizing is standardized THEN the system SHALL maintain proper page layout and scrolling behavior

### Requirement 6: Mock Data Removal

**User Story:** As a system administrator preparing for production testing, I want all mock miners removed from the application, so that the system is ready for real miner integration testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL NOT display any mock or placeholder miner data
2. WHEN no real miners are connected THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messaging
3. WHEN mock data is removed THEN the system SHALL maintain all data structure integrity for real miner connections
4. WHEN testing with real miners THEN the system SHALL properly display actual miner data without conflicts

### Requirement 7: Status Indicator Restoration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the top-right corner status indicator to show actual connection status instead of "Phase 1 Testing", so that I can monitor system connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is connected to mining services THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status
2. WHEN the application loses connection to mining services THEN the system SHALL display "Disconnected" status
3. WHEN connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update the indicator in real-time
4. WHEN the status indicator is displayed THEN the system SHALL NOT show "Phase 1 Testing" text

### Requirement 8: Refresh Button Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the refresh button in the top-right corner to be enabled and functional, so that I can manually update dashboard data when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refresh button is displayed THEN the system SHALL show it in an enabled state
2. WHEN a user clicks the refresh button THEN the system SHALL refresh all dashboard data and provide visual feedback
3. WHEN refresh is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and disable the button temporarily
4. WHEN refresh completes THEN the system SHALL re-enable the button and update all displayed information

### Requirement 9: Temperature Display Formatting

**User Story:** As a user viewing miner cards, I want temperature readings displayed as whole numbers without decimals, so that the information is clean and easy to read.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temperature data is displayed in miner cards THEN the system SHALL show only whole number values (e.g., 72, 65)
2. WHEN temperature data contains decimal values THEN the system SHALL round to the nearest whole number
3. WHEN temperature formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain data accuracy while improving readability
4. WHEN multiple miner cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL apply consistent temperature formatting across all cards
