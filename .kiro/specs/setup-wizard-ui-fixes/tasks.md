# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Comprehensive research and debugging of dropdown menu rendering issues
  - Inspect browser developer tools to examine DOM structure when dropdown is clicked (check if v-menu elements are being created)
  - Analyze CSS computed styles for v-select, v-overlay, and v-menu elements to identify style conflicts
  - Test dropdown behavior in isolation outside the wizard context to determine if issue is wizard-specific
  - Examine Vuetify version compatibility and check for known issues with v-select in overlay contexts
  - Investigate JavaScript console errors during dropdown interactions and Vue devtools component state
  - Check if dropdown options data is properly bound and accessible in component state
  - Examine z-index stacking context and CSS positioning of all parent containers
  - Verify if click events are being properly handled and not intercepted by other elements
  - Document all findings before attempting any fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement dropdown menu fixes based on research findings
  - dropdown-research-findings.md
  - Apply specific fixes identified during research phase for dropdown overlay positioning
  - Update CSS selectors and z-index values based on actual DOM structure analysis
  - Implement any necessary JavaScript fixes for event handling or component state management
  - Test dropdown functionality across all wizard screens after implementing fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 3. Research and analyze switch component visual state issues
  - Inspect switch component DOM structure and CSS classes in browser developer tools during on/off state changes
  - Examine current CSS selectors targeting switch states and identify which selectors are actually being applied
  - Test switch component behavior in isolation to determine if issue is context-specific or global
  - Check Vuetify documentation for correct CSS class names and state selectors for current version
  - Analyze CSS specificity conflicts that might be overriding switch state styles
  - Verify data binding and component state changes are properly triggering visual updates
  - Document current vs expected visual behavior with screenshots or detailed descriptions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 4. Implement switch component visual state fixes
  - switch-component-research-findings.md
  - Apply correct CSS selectors and styling based on research findings for switch on/off states
  - Update switch styling in both SettingsConfigScreen.vue and UserPreferencesScreen.vue
  - Test switch visual state changes across all affected wizard screens
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 5. Research and analyze scrolling layout issues in wizard steps
  - Examine current CSS layout structure and flex properties of wizard container and step-content elements
  - Measure actual content height vs container height in problematic wizard steps (especially step 4)
  - Test scrolling behavior across different screen sizes and identify specific breakpoints where issues occur
  - Analyze CSS overflow properties and container height calculations in current implementation
  - Check if content is actually overflowing or if layout issues are preventing proper height calculation
  - Investigate parent container constraints that might be limiting scrollable area
  - Document specific steps and screen sizes where Continue button becomes inaccessible
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement scrollable layout fixes for wizard step content
  - Apply proper overflow and height styling to step-content containers based on research findings
  - Update flex layout properties to ensure proper scrolling while maintaining header/footer positioning
  - Add responsive height calculations and touch scrolling support for mobile devices
  - Test Continue button accessibility across all wizard steps and screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Research and analyze progress bar visual update issues
  - Examine current progress bar value calculation and data binding in FirstRunWizard.vue component
  - Test progress bar behavior by manually stepping through wizard and observing visual changes
  - Check Vue devtools to verify currentStep state changes are properly reactive and triggering updates
  - Inspect CSS styles applied to v-progress-linear component and identify any overriding styles
  - Verify theme color variables are properly defined and accessible for progress bar styling
  - Test progress bar in different browsers to identify browser-specific rendering issues
  - Document current vs expected progress bar behavior at each wizard step
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 8. Implement progress bar visual update fixes
  - progress-bar-research-findings.md
  - Apply fixes for progress bar value calculation and reactivity based on research findings
  - Update CSS styling to ensure proper color display and remove any conflicting styles
  - Test progress bar visual updates across all wizard step transitions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_
