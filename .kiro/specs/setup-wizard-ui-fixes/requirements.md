# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI/UX issues in the setup wizard that prevent users from properly configuring the application. The setup wizard currently has multiple interface problems including non-functional dropdown menus, incorrect slider visual states, missing scroll functionality, and a non-updating progress indicator. These issues create a poor user experience and may prevent successful application setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user setting up the application, I want dropdown menus to display their options when clicked, so that I can select the appropriate configuration values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any dropdown menu in the setup wizard THEN the system SHALL display a list of available options below the dropdown
2. WHEN a dropdown menu is opened THEN the system SHALL show a visual indicator (arrow rotation) that the menu is expanded
3. WHEN a user clicks outside an open dropdown menu THEN the system SHALL close the dropdown and return the arrow to its original position
4. WHEN a user selects an option from a dropdown THEN the system SHALL update the dropdown display with the selected value and close the menu

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user configuring application settings, I want slider controls to visually indicate their current state, so that I can clearly see whether features are enabled or disabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a slider is in the "off" position THEN the system SHALL display the slider with grey coloring
2. WHEN a slider is in the "on" position THEN the system SHALL display the slider with orange coloring
3. WHEN a user toggles a slider from off to on THEN the system SHALL change the slider color from grey to orange
4. WHEN a user toggles a slider from on to off THEN the system SHALL change the slider color from orange to grey
5. WHEN the setup wizard loads THEN the system SHALL display all sliders with colors that accurately reflect their current state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user navigating through setup wizard steps, I want to be able to scroll through all content on each page, so that I can view all configuration options and access navigation buttons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a setup wizard step contains more content than fits in the visible area THEN the system SHALL provide vertical scrolling functionality
2. WHEN a user scrolls on a setup wizard step THEN the system SHALL allow access to all content including the Continue button
3. WHEN a user reaches step 4 of the setup wizard THEN the system SHALL ensure the Continue button is accessible through scrolling
4. WHEN content overflows the visible area THEN the system SHALL display appropriate scroll indicators (scrollbars or visual cues)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user progressing through the setup wizard, I want to see my progress visually indicated, so that I know how many steps remain and can track my completion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a setup wizard step THEN the system SHALL update the progress bar to reflect the current step completion
2. WHEN a user moves to the next step THEN the system SHALL fill in the progress indicator with color for completed steps
3. WHEN a user is on a specific step THEN the system SHALL highlight the current step in the progress bar
4. WHEN the setup wizard loads THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar that accurately shows the current position in the setup process
5. WHEN a user navigates backward through steps THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate progress indication
