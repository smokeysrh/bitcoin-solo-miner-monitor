# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and architectural issues identified in the Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitoring App code review. The primary focus is on fixing deployment blockers, security risks, and improving code reliability while maintaining existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Import and Dependency Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have all necessary imports and dependencies properly defined, so that the application can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API service is started THEN the User class SHALL be properly imported and available for token verification
2. WHEN building the Docker containers THEN all Python dependencies SHALL be available in requirements.txt
3. WHEN building the frontend THEN all Node.js dependencies SHALL be available in package.json
4. WHEN running the application THEN no import errors SHALL occur during startup
5. WHEN deploying to any environment THEN all dependency files SHALL be present and complete

### Requirement 2: Remove Authentication System for Local Network Use

**User Story:** As a home solo miner, I want to access the monitoring application without needing to create accounts or login, so that I can quickly monitor my miners on my secure local network without authentication overhead.

**Context:** The current application includes a full user authentication system with username/password login, JWT tokens, API keys, and role-based access control. This is unnecessary complexity for a home mining setup that runs on a secure local network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL not require any user authentication or login
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL not require authentication tokens or API keys
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL not require authentication
4. WHEN the application is accessed THEN all features SHALL be immediately available without login
5. WHEN the user database exists THEN it SHALL be safely removed without affecting miner configurations
6. WHEN authentication middleware is removed THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work
7. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL not redirect to login or setup pages for authentication

### Requirement 3: Simplified Local Data Storage

**User Story:** As a home solo miner, I want all my mining data to be stored in a simple, single database file on my machine, so that installation is easy and my data never leaves my local network.

**Context:** The application currently requires both SQLite (for configurations) and InfluxDB (for metrics). InfluxDB is an external dependency that complicates installation for home users. For simplicity and ease of deployment, all data should be stored in SQLite only.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application stores miner configurations THEN they SHALL be stored in a local SQLite database only
2. WHEN the application stores metrics data THEN it SHALL be stored in the same local SQLite database, not InfluxDB
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL not require InfluxDB to be installed or running
4. WHEN time-series metrics are stored THEN SQLite SHALL be used with appropriate table design for time-series data
5. WHEN the application is installed THEN it SHALL create only a single database file with no external dependencies
6. WHEN network requests are made THEN they SHALL only be to local network miners, never to external services
7. WHEN logs are written THEN they SHALL be stored locally in the application directory
8. WHEN data backup is performed THEN it SHALL backup the single SQLite database file only

### Requirement 4: Database Connection Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database connections to be reliable and non-blocking, so that the application performs well under load and doesn't experience connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application connects to SQLite THEN it SHALL use async-compatible database connections
2. WHEN multiple database operations occur concurrently THEN they SHALL not block each other
3. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all database connections SHALL be properly closed
5. WHEN database operations timeout THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be triggered

### Requirement 5: HTTP Session Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want HTTP client sessions to be properly managed, so that the application doesn't leak memory or exhaust connection pools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP sessions are created THEN they SHALL be properly closed in all code paths
2. WHEN miner connections fail THEN HTTP sessions SHALL be cleaned up automatically
3. WHEN the application shuts down THEN all HTTP sessions SHALL be properly closed
4. WHEN HTTP operations timeout THEN sessions SHALL be cleaned up appropriately
5. WHEN connection errors occur THEN session cleanup SHALL happen in exception handlers

### Requirement 6: Path and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file paths and configuration to be robust and maintainable, so that the application works reliably across different environments and deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application determines file paths THEN it SHALL use Path objects instead of string concatenation
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL be validated for required values
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all required directories SHALL be created automatically
4. WHEN running in different environments THEN paths SHALL resolve correctly
5. WHEN configuration is missing THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging Improvements

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions occur THEN they SHALL be caught with specific exception types where possible
2. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
4. WHEN recoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff
5. WHEN logging is configured THEN it SHALL include structured logging for better analysis

### Requirement 8: Input Validation and Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all user inputs to be properly validated, so that the application is protected against injection attacks and invalid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IP addresses are provided THEN they SHALL be validated as proper IP addresses
2. WHEN port numbers are provided THEN they SHALL be validated as valid port ranges
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN input data SHALL be sanitized and validated
4. WHEN SQL queries are executed THEN they SHALL use parameterized queries only
5. WHEN user data is processed THEN it SHALL be validated against expected schemas

### Requirement 9: Concurrency and Thread Safety

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle concurrent operations safely, so that data corruption and race conditions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access shared data THEN appropriate locking mechanisms SHALL be used
2. WHEN async operations are performed THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
3. WHEN miner data is updated THEN updates SHALL be atomic and consistent
4. WHEN WebSocket connections are managed THEN connection state SHALL be thread-safe
5. WHEN the application handles multiple requests THEN shared resources SHALL be protected

### Requirement 10: WebSocket Reliability for Local Network
