4. WHEN navigation elements are present THEN they SHALL have clear active states and smooth transitions
5. WHEN loading states occur THEN they SHALL use consistent spinner designs with Bitcoin Orange accents

### Requirement 5: Installer Wizard Styling Consistency

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the installation wizard to have the same professional appearance as the main application, so that I have confidence in the software quality from the first interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the installer wizard loads THEN it SHALL use the same dark theme as the main application
2. WHEN progressing through installer steps THEN the navigation SHALL use Bitcoin Orange for active states
3. WHEN installer forms are displayed THEN they SHALL match the main application's form styling
4. WHEN installer buttons are shown THEN they SHALL use the same styling patterns as the main application
5. WHEN installer cards or panels appear THEN they SHALL have consistent elevation and spacing

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design Consistency

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the dark theme and styling to work properly across all screen sizes, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the dark theme SHALL maintain proper contrast and readability
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN spacing and typography SHALL scale appropriately
3. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN buttons and interactive elements SHALL have appropriate touch targets
4. WHEN content overflows THEN scrolling areas SHALL have consistent dark styling
5. WHEN responsive breakpoints are reached THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL remain clear and professional

### Requirement 7: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want the dark theme to meet accessibility standards, so that I can use the application effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN interactive elements are focused THEN they SHALL have clear focus indicators that meet accessibility standards
3. WHEN colors convey information THEN alternative indicators SHALL be provided for colorblind users
4. WHEN hover states are shown THEN they SHALL not be the only way to indicate interactivity
5. WHEN animations are present THEN they SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Requirement 8: Bitcoin Logo Integration

**User Story:** As a Bitcoin enthusiast, I want to see Bitcoin logos integrated throughout the interface in appropriate places, so that the application clearly represents its Bitcoin-focused purpose.
