Always use run.py to start the application for testing. use peppeteer to intteract with the application when testing.

If the server is already running just navigate to it, dont kill it and restart it for no reason. Since we are always using run.py for testing, the server will always be running on port 8000.

Use npm run build, make sure you are in the frontend before running it though.
