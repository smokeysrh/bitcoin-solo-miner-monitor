When debugging, never assume the first issue you come across is the source of the bug, dig deeper, continue to build context around the issue at hand so that we better diagnose bugs with better accuracy and implement the proper solutions.

Use the filesystem mcp to assist in gathering full context around a bug or issue before implementing solutions.

Always keep a clean and well structured file stystem using industry standard best practices.

I do not want you to test fixes using puppeteer, I want you to implement the changes required by the task and then ask me to test them, I will report back to you my findings and we will go from there. You may still use it to debug and verify.
