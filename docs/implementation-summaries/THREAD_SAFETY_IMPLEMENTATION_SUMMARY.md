# Thread Safety Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of proper locking for shared resources in the Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitoring App, addressing task 9.1 from the bug fixes and security enhancement specification.

## Implemented Components

### 1. AsyncRWLock (Reader-Writer Lock)

**Location**: `src/backend/utils/thread_safety.py`

**Purpose**: Provides async reader-writer lock implementation allowing multiple readers or single writer access to shared resources.

**Features**:
- Multiple concurrent readers when no writers are active
- Exclusive writer access that blocks all readers and other writers
- Async context manager support for easy usage
- Proper cleanup and notification mechanisms

**Usage Example**:
```python
lock = AsyncRWLock()

# Read access (multiple readers allowed)
async with lock.read_lock():
    data = shared_resource.read()

# Write access (exclusive)
async with lock.write_lock():
    shared_resource.write(new_data)
```

### 2. ThreadSafeMinerDataManager

- `atomic_transaction()`: Context manager for custom transactions

**Integration**: Integrated into `DataStorage` service for critical database operations.

### 5. ThreadSafeCache

**Location**: `src/backend/utils/thread_safety.py`

**Purpose**: Thread-safe cache implementation with TTL support and automatic cleanup.

**Features**:
- Thread-safe get/set/delete operations
- TTL (Time To Live) support with automatic expiration
- Concurrent access protection
- Cache statistics
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- Generic type support

**Key Methods**:
- `get(key)`: Thread-safe value retrieval
