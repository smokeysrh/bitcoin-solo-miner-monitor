# Community Security Audit Guide

## Overview

The Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor project embraces open-source security principles through transparent, community-driven security auditing. This guide provides comprehensive instructions for community members to participate in security audits, verify builds, and contribute to the project's security posture.

## Security Audit Principles

### Open Source Security Philosophy

Our security approach follows Bitcoin's core principles:

- **Transparency**: All security processes are open and auditable
- **Decentralization**: No reliance on centralized certificate authorities
- **Community Verification**: Security through collective review and validation
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build processes for independent verification

### Community-Driven Security

- **Collaborative Review**: Multiple community members review security aspects
- **Public Documentation**: All security processes are publicly documented
- **Transparent Reporting**: Security findings are shared openly with the community
- **Inclusive Participation**: Security auditing is accessible to various skill levels

## Getting Started with Security Auditing

### Prerequisites

#### Technical Requirements

**Basic Level (Code Review):**
- Git version control knowledge
- Basic understanding of Python and JavaScript
- Familiarity with web application security concepts

**Intermediate Level (Build Verification):**
- Command line proficiency
- Understanding of build systems and dependency management
- Knowledge of cryptographic hashing (SHA256)

**Advanced Level (Deep Security Analysis):**
- Security testing tools experience
- Static and dynamic analysis knowledge
- Understanding of vulnerability assessment methodologies

#### Required Tools

```bash
# Essential tools for security auditing
git clone https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor.git
cd bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install security scanning tools
pip install safety bandit pip-audit

# Install Node.js dependencies (for frontend analysis)
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm audit
```

### Security Audit Areas

#### 1. Source Code Security Review

**Focus Areas:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Cryptographic implementations
- Error handling and information disclosure
- Dependency security

**Review Process:**
1. **Code Analysis**: Review source code for security vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency Check**: Analyze third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities
3. **Configuration Review**: Examine configuration files for security misconfigurations
4. **Documentation Review**: Verify security documentation accuracy

**Tools and Commands:**
```bash
# Static code analysis
bandit -r src/ -f json -o security-reports/bandit-report.json

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
safety check --json --output security-reports/safety-report.json
pip-audit --format=json --output=security-reports/pip-audit-report.json

# Node.js dependency audit
cd src/frontend
npm audit --json > ../../security-reports/npm-audit-report.json
```

#### 2. Build Process Verification

**Reproducible Build Verification:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Create clean build environment
2. **Source Verification**: Verify source code integrity
3. **Build Execution**: Execute build process following documented procedures
4. **Artifact Comparison**: Compare generated artifacts with official releases

**Build Verification Process:**
```bash
# 1. Clean environment setup
git clone https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor.git
cd bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor
git checkout v1.0.0  # Replace with target version

# 2. Verify source integrity
git verify-commit HEAD  # If commits are signed
sha256sum -c checksums.txt  # If checksums provided

# 3. Execute reproducible build
python tools/build/build-from-source.py --reproducible

# 4. Generate and compare checksums
sha256sum dist/* > community-checksums.txt
# Compare with official checksums
diff community-checksums.txt official-checksums.txt
```

#### 3. Installer Security Analysis

**Installer Verification:**
- File integrity and authenticity
- Embedded dependency analysis
- Installation process security
- Uninstallation completeness

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Automated installer security scanning
python scripts/security/installer-security-scanner.py \
  dist/BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe \
  --format markdown \
  --output-dir security-reports

# Manual verification steps
sha256sum dist/BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe
file dist/BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe
```

#### 4. Runtime Security Testing

**Dynamic Analysis:**
- Application behavior analysis
- Network communication security
- File system access patterns
- Process and memory analysis

**Testing Approach:**
```bash
# Start application in test environment
python run.py --test-mode

# Monitor network connections
netstat -an | grep :8000

# Check file system access
# Use process monitoring tools appropriate for your OS
```
