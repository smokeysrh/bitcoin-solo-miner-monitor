# Security Guide

## Overview

Security is paramount when installing Bitcoin-related software. This guide explains how to safely install and verify Bitcoin Solo Miner Monitor, understand security warnings, and protect your mining operations.

## üîí Security Philosophy

**Open Source Security**: We believe in transparency and community verification rather than relying on expensive certificates or centralized authorities. This approach aligns with Bitcoin's decentralized principles.

**Community Trust**: Our security model is based on:
- **Open source code** - Anyone can audit the software
- **Reproducible builds** - Anyone can verify our releases
- **Community verification** - Multiple people check our work
- **Transparent processes** - All builds happen in public

## Understanding Security Warnings

### Why You See Security Warnings

**Common warnings you'll encounter**:
- "Unknown Publisher" (Windows)
- "Unidentified Developer" (macOS)
- "Unsigned Package" (Linux)
- Antivirus false positives

**Why these warnings appear**:

1. **Code Signing Certificates Cost $300-500/year**
   - Individual developers often can't afford these
   - Many legitimate open-source projects show similar warnings
   - Certificate authorities don't validate software quality, only identity

2. **Mining Software Triggers Antivirus**
   - Mining software shares characteristics with malicious miners
   - Antivirus software uses heuristics that flag legitimate mining tools
   - This is a known issue across the entire mining ecosystem

3. **New Software Lacks "Reputation"**
   - Operating systems track download frequency
   - New or infrequently downloaded software triggers warnings
   - This is normal for specialized tools like mining software

### This is Normal in Bitcoin Ecosystem

**Popular Bitcoin software with similar warnings**:
- Bitcoin Core (official Bitcoin client)
- Electrum wallet
- BTCPay Server
- Most mining software (CGMiner, BFGMiner, etc.)
- Hardware wallet software

**The Bitcoin community has established practices** for safely installing software without relying on centralized certificate authorities.

## Safe Installation Practices

### 1. Verify Download Source

**‚úÖ Safe Sources**:
- Official GitHub releases: `https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/releases`
- Direct links from project documentation

**‚ùå Unsafe Sources**:
- Third-party download sites
- Torrents or file sharing
- Email attachments
- Social media links

**Verification Steps**:
```bash
# Check the URL carefully
# Correct: https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor
# Incorrect: https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitr (missing 'o')
# Incorrect: https://githab.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor (wrong domain)
```

### 2. Checksum Verification

**Why checksums matter**:
- Detect corrupted downloads
- Verify file integrity
- Ensure you have the exact file we built

**How to verify checksums**:

**Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
# Download the checksums file
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/releases/download/v1.0.0/SHA256SUMS" -OutFile "SHA256SUMS"

# Calculate checksum of your download
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe

# Compare with the value in SHA256SUMS file
Get-Content SHA256SUMS | Select-String "BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe"
```

**macOS**:
```bash
# Download checksums
curl -O https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/releases/download/v1.0.0/SHA256SUMS

# Verify your download
shasum -a 256 BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor.dmg

# Compare with checksums file
grep "BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor.dmg" SHA256SUMS
```

**Linux**:
```bash
# Download checksums
wget https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/releases/download/v1.0.0/SHA256SUMS

# Verify all downloads at once
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing

# Or verify specific file
sha256sum bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor_1.0.0_amd64.deb
grep "bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor_1.0.0_amd64.deb" SHA256SUMS
```

### 3. Reproducible Build Verification

**For maximum security**, build from source and compare checksums:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor.git
cd bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor

# Checkout the exact release tag
git checkout v1.0.0

# Build the installer
python scripts/create-distribution.py --version 1.0.0

# Compare your build checksum with official release
sha256sum distribution/windows/BitcoinSoloMinerMonitor-Setup.exe
```

**If checksums match**, you can be confident the official release is authentic.
