## üîí Security and Trust

### Understanding Security Warnings

**Why you see warnings with open-source Bitcoin software:**
- No expensive code signing certificates ($300-500/year for individual developers)
- Mining software commonly flagged by antivirus (false positives)
- "Unknown Publisher" warnings are normal for community-developed software
- **This is standard in the Bitcoin ecosystem** - Bitcoin Core, Electrum, and most mining tools show similar warnings

### Safe Installation Process

**‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Download Source**
- **Official source only**: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/releases)
- **Check URL carefully**: Ensure exact match to avoid phishing

**‚úÖ Step 2: Verify File Integrity**
- Download `SHA256SUMS` file from the same release
- Compare checksums before installation (detailed instructions in platform guides)
- **This proves file authenticity** without relying on certificates

**‚úÖ Step 3: Handle Security Warnings Safely**
- Follow platform-specific instructions in our guides
- Understand why warnings appear (see [Security Guide](security-guide.md))
- Proceed confidently after verification

**üîß Maximum Security: Build from Source**
- Complete instructions: [BUILD.md](../BUILD.md)
- Compare your build checksums with official releases
