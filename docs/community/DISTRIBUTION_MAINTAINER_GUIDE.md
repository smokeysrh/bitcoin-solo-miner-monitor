# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/smokeysrh/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor.git
cd bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor

# Set up development environment for your platform
# (See platform-specific sections below)

# Test the existing build process
python scripts/create-distribution.py --version dev-test
```

**Testing Environment**
- Set up clean virtual machines or containers for testing
- Install your target platform's packaging tools
- Create test user accounts with limited privileges
- Document your testing environment setup

### Step 4: Create Initial Package

**Study Existing Packages**
- Review similar Bitcoin or cryptocurrency software packages on your platform
- Understand platform-specific conventions and requirements
- Identify common patterns and best practices
- Note any special considerations for mining software

**Create Package Definition**
- Start with the simplest possible package that works
- Focus on core functionality first

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Packaging Issues

**Dependency Management**
```bash
# Issue: Missing dependencies
# Solution: Comprehensive dependency analysis
ldd /path/to/binary  # Linux
otool -L /path/to/binary  # macOS
dumpbin /dependents binary.exe  # Windows

# Issue: Version conflicts
# Solution: Pin specific versions in package metadata
```

**Desktop Integration**
```bash
# Issue: Desktop entries not appearing
# Solution: Verify desktop file installation and update desktop database
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
update-desktop-database /usr/share/applications/

# Issue: File associations not working
# Solution: Check MIME type registration
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/
update-mime-database /usr/share/mime/
```

**Permission Issues**
```bash
# Issue: Application won't start due to permissions
# Solution: Check file permissions and ownership
find /opt/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find /opt/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
chmod +x /opt/bitcoin-solo-miner-monitor/run.py
```

### Best Practices

**Package Development**
- Start simple and add complexity incrementally
- Test on multiple versions of your target platform
- Follow platform conventions and guidelines strictly
- Document all decisions and trade-offs
- Use version control for package definitions

**Quality Assurance**
- Test installation on clean systems
- Verify all functionality works after packaging
- Test upgrade and downgrade scenarios
- Validate uninstallation removes all files
- Check for conflicts with other packages

**Community Engagement**
- Respond to user issues promptly and helpfully
- Participate in maintainer discussions and planning
- Share knowledge and best practices
- Mentor new contributors when possible
- Provide feedback on upstream development

**Long-term Maintenance**
- Keep packages updated with upstream releases
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Maintain compatibility with platform updates
- Plan for maintainer succession if needed
- Document processes for continuity
